This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel.
